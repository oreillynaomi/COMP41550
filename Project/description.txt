This might be too simple an idea but for my project I would like to create a version of the game breakout.

Something similar to this but a bit more exciting: http://pdroms.de/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/20071209_Cube_Breakout_v3.6_(NDS_Game).PNG

I intend on having the option for single player and 2 player so players can challenge each other.
